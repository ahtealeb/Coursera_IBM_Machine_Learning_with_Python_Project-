You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass
